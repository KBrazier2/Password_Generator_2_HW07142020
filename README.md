# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at [some examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

The following is Homework 3 where we were tasked with creating a password generator. The user is prompted to select certain criteria in order to generate a random password using those prefered criteria.

- Created variables for the function writePassword
- Created prompts, and confirms, to have criteria selected
- Linked variables from said function to function generatePassword
- Created arrays for all possible characters
- Each array contains characters specified for each criteria type
- Created if statements to determine the user's choice of preferences
- Used for loops to include math.random in order to generate random characters
- Created all possible outcomes for if statements
- Generate button is called when clicked
